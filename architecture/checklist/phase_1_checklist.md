# Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Setup (Largely Complete)

*   **Detailed Description:** This foundational phase establishes the core project infrastructure, development environment, and essential cross-cutting concerns like authentication. It involves setting up the monorepo structure, configuring containerization for consistent environments across backend (FastAPI), frontend (Next.js), and data stores (Neo4j, MinIO), establishing basic communication between the frontend and backend via the API Gateway, and implementing the initial User Authentication service. While largely complete, the architecture document notes that full integration of subsequent service routers into the main FastAPI application (`backend/app/main.py`) is still pending and will occur in later phases as each service is developed.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [X] Initialize project repository with Git.
    *   [X] Define backend project structure using Poetry (`backend/pyproject.toml`).
    *   [X] Define frontend project structure using npm/yarn (`frontend/package.json`).
    *   [X] Create `docker-compose.yml` defining services for:
        *   [X] FastAPI Backend (`backend`)
        *   [X] Next.js Frontend (`frontend`)
        *   [X] Neo4j Database (`graphdb`)
        *   [X] MinIO Object Storage (`objectstore`)
    *   [X] Implement basic FastAPI application (`backend/app/main.py`) with a health check endpoint.
    *   [X] Implement basic Next.js application (`frontend/pages/index.tsx`) capable of making API calls.
    *   [X] Establish basic API Gateway functionality within the FastAPI app to route frontend requests (initially just for health check/auth).
    *   [X] Implement Authentication Service (`backend/app/auth/`):
        *   [X] Define user schemas (`schemas.py`).
        *   [X] Implement CRUD operations for users (`crud.py`), interacting with Neo4j.
        *   [X] Implement security functions (password hashing, token generation/verification) (`security.py`).
        *   [X] Create API router (`router.py`) for login, user creation, token validation.
        *   [X] Integrate Auth router into the main FastAPI application (`backend/app/main.py`).
    *   [X] Implement basic login/authentication flow in the frontend (`frontend/pages/login.tsx`).
    *   [X] Configure database connection session management (`backend/app/db/session.py`).
    *   [X] Configure application settings (`backend/app/core/config.py`).
    *   [ ] *Pending:* Placeholder/Structure for integrating future service routers in `backend/app/main.py`.
