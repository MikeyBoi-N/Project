# Phase 3: Djinn

*   **Detailed Description:** This phase introduces the Djinn (Computer Vision) service MVP. The focus is on ingesting images, performing basic object detection using a pre-trained model, storing the results, and visualizing these results on the `Shared Map Component`. This involves creating the Djinn backend service, integrating CV libraries (like OpenCV, PyTorch/TensorFlow), implementing image ingestion (storing binaries in MinIO, metadata in Neo4j), running object detection, storing detected object metadata (class, bounding box, confidence) and *location* in Neo4j (linked to the source image), and crucially, extending the API Gateway and frontend map component to display these detected object locations. The Djinn router must be integrated into the main FastAPI app.

Project Overview: Djinn - Computer Vision for Automatic Target Recognition

Djinn is a **computer vision engine** designed for **automatic target recognition (ATR)**. Its primary function is to **automatically detect and identify objects or entities** from imagery.

Key features and capabilities of Djinn include:

*   **Imagery Processing**: Djinn **processes various types of imagery, specifically Electro-Optical (EO) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** data. This allows it to analyze visual information captured by different sensor technologies.
*   **Data Sources**: Djinn is designed to work with **satellite and aerial imagery** for object detection [Your Query, 100]. It can ingest and analyze visual data obtained from these platforms.
*   **Object Detection, Identification, and Tracking**: Djinn is capable of **detecting, identifying, and tracking objects of interest** within the processed imagery. The initial phase of the service (MVP) focuses on basic object detection using pre-trained models.
*   **Visualization**: Detected object locations are visualized directly on a **map interface using the `Shared Map Component`**, providing concise, geolocated results and enhancing situational awareness.
*   **Technology Stack**: Djinn leverages several key technologies for its operation:
    *   **Computer Vision Libraries**: It integrates with established computer vision libraries such as **OpenCV, PyTorch, and TensorFlow** for image analysis and object detection.
    *   **Data Storage**: Image binaries are stored in **MinIO**, while metadata about the images and detected objects (including class, bounding box, confidence, and location) are stored in **Neo4j**, linked to the source image.
    *   **API and Frontend**: The system includes extensions to the **API Gateway and the frontend map component** to enable the display of detected object locations. The **Djinn router is integrated into the main FastAPI application**.
*   **Workflow**: The process involves **ingesting images**, performing object detection, storing the resulting metadata (including location), and then displaying these locations on a map.

In essence, Djinn automates the analysis of large volumes of visual data from satellite and aerial imagery to detect, identify, and track objects of interest, presenting the results in a user-friendly, geolocated format. This accelerates analysis and enhances situational awareness for users.


For developing an app for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) and object detection of military objects like airplanes, tanks, and missiles in satellite imagery, several libraries are standard in the field of computer vision and deep learning. These libraries provide the necessary tools and functionalities for image processing, feature extraction, model building, and object detection. Here are some of the most prominent ones:

*   **OpenCV** is a widely used open-source computer vision library offering a comprehensive set of tools for image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. It supports multiple programming languages like Python, C++, and Java, making it versatile for different development environments. OpenCV is known for its extensive documentation and strong community support. It provides functionalities that can be crucial for pre-processing satellite imagery and implementing various object detection algorithms, including traditional methods.

*   **TensorFlow** is a powerful open-source machine learning framework that is extensively used for building and training deep learning models for object detection. It has a large and active community, providing ample resources and support. NASA's DELTA (Deep Earth Learning, Tools, and Analysis) framework for satellite imagery analysis is based on TensorFlow. The TensorFlow Object Detection API is particularly relevant for developing object detection models for identifying objects like solar panels, buildings, and even potential military targets in satellite imagery.

*   **PyTorch** is another popular open-source machine learning framework, especially favored for its flexibility and ease of use in research and development. Many state-of-the-art object detection models and remote sensing analysis tools are implemented in PyTorch. Libraries like **TorchGeo** specifically extend PyTorch for geospatial data, providing datasets, samplers, transforms, and pre-trained models relevant to satellite imagery. PyTorch is also the backend for other high-level libraries like Detectron2.

*   **Detectron2**, developed by Facebook AI Research, is a library built on top of PyTorch that is specifically designed for object detection and segmentation tasks. It offers state-of-the-art models and is highly customizable, making it suitable for advanced object recognition tasks in satellite imagery, such as identifying different types of vehicles or infrastructure.

*   **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a family of real-time object detection architectures that are highly popular for their speed and accuracy. Various implementations and versions of YOLO (like YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLO-world) are frequently used for object detection in aerial and satellite imagery, including detecting aircraft, ships, and other objects. YOLO-world is even proposed for zero-shot ATR of novel classes.

*   **Faster R-CNN** is a widely recognized and effective object detection architecture often used as a baseline and for achieving high accuracy in object localization. Implementations of Faster R-CNN in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are commonly used for detecting objects in satellite imagery, including aircraft and ships.

*   **RetinaNet** is another popular single-stage object detection model known for its performance in handling imbalanced datasets, which can be common in satellite imagery where target objects might be small compared to the background. It is used for various object detection tasks in this domain, such as identifying cars, swimming pools, and ships.

*   **OpenMMLab** is a comprehensive open-source toolbox for a wide range of computer vision tasks, including object detection, segmentation, and classification. It provides a modular design that supports various backbones and algorithms. **MMDetection** is a part of OpenMMLab specifically focused on object detection and is built on PyTorch.

While not strictly libraries for implementation, it's important to note that the development and evaluation of ATR systems often rely on specific datasets like **MSTAR (Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Identification)**, which contains SAR imagery of military targets. Understanding the characteristics of such datasets is crucial for building effective ATR applications.

The choice of library often depends on factors like the specific requirements of your application (e.g., real-time processing, accuracy needs), your familiarity with the framework, and the available resources and community support. Combining these libraries and leveraging pre-trained models or training your own models on relevant satellite imagery datasets will be key to developing your ATR application.
