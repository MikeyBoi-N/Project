# Subsequent Phases

*   **Detailed Description:** Following the MVPs, development will focus on enhancing the capabilities of each individual service and improving their integration for true data fusion. This includes incorporating more advanced AI/ML models (like Google Gemini for Kappa, custom-trained models for Djinn), enabling real-time processing (especially for Ghost and potentially Tesseract), implementing sophisticated data fusion logic (likely involving inter-service communication or dedicated fusion services orchestrated via the API Gateway or message queues), building out collaboration features (sharing analysis states, annotations), refining the UI/UX based on user feedback, and significantly improving the `Shared Map Component`'s capabilities (advanced layering, filtering, temporal controls, richer interactions). Performance optimization, scalability enhancements, and robust model management pipelines will also be key focus areas.
