# Debugging Log: Sidebar ResizableBox Build Error

## Task Summary

A persistent build error `Uncaught ModuleBuildError: Module build failed (...) Error: Ã— Unexpected token \`ResizableBox\`. Expected jsx identifier` occurs in `frontend/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` when attempting to use the `<ResizableBox>` component from the `react-resizable` library. The error prevents the application from building successfully.

## Findings

1.  **Error Location:** The build error message consistently points to the line where the `<ResizableBox>` JSX tag is used in `Sidebar.tsx` (around line 159).
2.  **Import Verification:** The necessary import statement `import { ResizableBox, ResizeCallbackData } from 'react-resizable';` is correctly present at the top of `Sidebar.tsx` (checked line 2). No duplicate imports exist.
3.  **Dependency Verification:** The `react-resizable` package (v3.0.5) and its corresponding types `@types/react-resizable` (v3.0.8) are correctly listed as dependencies in `frontend/package.json`.
4.  **Syntax Check:** The JSX syntax for using `<ResizableBox ...>` appears correct based on standard usage and the code snippet reviewed (lines 158-168).

## Fixes Tried & Failures

1.  **Initial Implementation:** Introduced `ResizableBox` component. (Failed: Build error occurred).
2.  **Add Import:** Ensured `ResizableBox` was imported. (Failed: Error persisted, likely due to a temporary duplicate import).
3.  **Remove Duplicate Import:** Corrected the imports, leaving only the necessary one. (Failed: The exact same build error persisted).

## Current Issues

The application build consistently fails with the `Unexpected token ResizableBox` error, despite the code appearing correct regarding imports and syntax.

## Reason for Past Failures

Initial attempts focused solely on code-level issues (imports). The persistence of the error after correcting imports suggests the root cause is likely environmental, such as corrupted installed packages or a stale build cache, which the build tool (Next.js/Webpack) relies on.

## Proposed Solution

Clean the frontend Node.js build environment. This involves:
1.  Stopping the development server.
2.  Removing the `frontend/node_modules` directory.
3.  Removing the `frontend/.next` directory (Next.js build cache).
4.  Reinstalling all dependencies using `npm install` (or `yarn install`) within the `frontend` directory.
5.  Restarting the development server (`npm run dev`).

## Code Effects

This solution does not modify the source code (`Sidebar.tsx`, `Layout.module.css`). It resets the installed dependencies and build artifacts. If successful, the build tool should correctly recognize the `ResizableBox` component upon restart.

## Investigative Questions

1.  Were there any errors or warnings during the initial `npm install` of `react-resizable`?
2.  Are there any unusual global Node.js or npm configurations that might affect package resolution?
3.  Could there be a subtle version incompatibility between Next.js (14.2.3), React (18), and `react-resizable` (3.0.5) that isn't immediately obvious?
4.  Is the development server (`npm run dev`) being reliably stopped and fully restarted between fix attempts?
5.  Does the `next.config.js` file contain any custom Webpack or Babel configurations that might interfere with standard module processing?
