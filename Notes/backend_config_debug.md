# Backend Configuration Debugging Report

## Task Summary
The backend application fails to start due to a `pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError`. The error message indicates that required settings (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`) are missing during application initialization.

## Findings
- The error originates from `backend/app/core/config.py` when the `Settings()` object is instantiated (line 46).
- The `Settings` class defines `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` as required string fields without default values (lines 33-35).
- Pydantic is configured to load settings from environment variables or a `.env` file located in the execution directory (`backend/`) (line 39).
- The traceback confirms these settings were not found in the environment or a `.env` file when the command `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000` was executed from `F:\Selkie\Project\backend`.

## Fixes Tried
- None attempted yet.

## Current Issues
- The application cannot start due to the Pydantic `ValidationError` for the missing Google OAuth settings.

## Failed Changes
- N/A

## Proposed Solution
1.  Create or update a file named `.env` inside the `F:\Selkie\Project\backend` directory.
2.  Add the following lines to the `backend/.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual Google Cloud credentials:
    ```dotenv
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
    GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=YOUR_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI_HERE
    ```
3.  Ensure any other required secrets (like `NEO4J_PASSWORD` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` defined in `config.py`) are also present in the `.env` file or set as environment variables.
4.  Rerun the command: `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000` from the `backend` directory.

## Five Questions
1.  Do you already have a `.env` file in the `F:\Selkie\Project\backend` directory?
2.  Have you obtained the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` from your Google Cloud Console project?
3.  What is the correct `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` configured in your Google Cloud Console OAuth consent screen for this application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/auth/google/callback`)?
4.  Are the `NEO4J_PASSWORD` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` settings currently defined either in environment variables or in the `.env` file?
5.  Is Google OAuth authentication essential for the immediate functionality you are trying to test, or could these settings potentially be made optional in `config.py` for local development if Google login isn't needed right now?

## Code Effects
- If the `.env` file is correctly created/updated with valid credentials, the Pydantic validation should pass, allowing the Uvicorn server to start successfully.
- If other required settings (like Neo4j/Minio passwords) are missing, similar validation errors might occur for those fields.
